On the brink of giving an introduction to MEI (https://www.music-encoding.org), I'm just familiarising myself with several technologies to provide better sharable content for the participants of the workshop.

I hope GitHub pages and Jekyll paired with reveal.js will do the job!

Aside from getting to work on the above, I have to upgrade my node and npm packages to fully take advantage of local slide development with reveal.js.
