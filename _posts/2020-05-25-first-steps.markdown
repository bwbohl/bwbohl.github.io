On the brink of giving an introduction to MEI (https://www.music-encoding.org) I'm just familiarizing myself with several techniologies in order to provide better sharable contents for the participants of the workshop.

I hope github-pages and jekyll paired with reveal.js will do the job!

Turns out beside getting to work the above I have to upgrade my node and npm packages to fully take advantage of local slides development with reveal.js.
